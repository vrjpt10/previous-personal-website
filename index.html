                            <p>Build and trained a CNN in Keras to recognize facial expressions. The objective was to classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of the seven categories and serve the trained model predictions
                                to a web interface and perform real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data.</p>

                            <p>A web-based application was presented for automatic detection of deep fake replacement and reenactment. A novel Res-Next convolution neural network was used for face reenactment, which can handle pose and expression variations
                                and can be applied to single images or video sequences. The network extracts frame-level features and uses them to train a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to classify whether a video has
